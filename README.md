📈 Sales Forecasting Using Prophet
Welcome to my Sales Forecasting project!
In this project, I built a robust time series forecasting model using Facebook Prophet to predict future sales based on historical data.

🚀 Project Overview
This project covers the complete lifecycle of a time series forecasting model:

Preprocessing and analyzing historical sales data

Identifying seasonal patterns (weekly and yearly)

Building a forecasting model with Prophet

Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance

Evaluating predictions using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics

Visualizing forecasts with confidence intervals

🎯 Goals of the Project
Capture complex seasonality patterns in sales

Generate actionable sales forecasts to assist in inventory planning

Enhance forecasting accuracy through hyperparameter tuning

Visualize historical data, forecasted trends, and error metrics

🛠️ Tools and Technologies

📚 Key Concepts Learned
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

Working with Facebook Prophet for modeling

Creating compelling visualizations of forecasts

Model evaluation using multiple metrics

Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., changepoint_prior_scale)

📈 Project Workflow
Data Preparation
Cleaned and structured historical sales data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified trends, seasonality, and outliers.

Model Building with Prophet
Created a model with multiplicative seasonality, tuned changepoint prior.

Validation
Measured model performance using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Forecasting
Forecasted sales for the next 90 days with confidence intervals.

Visualization
Plotted historical data, forecasts, and forecast uncertainty bands.

📊 Results
Detected Strong Seasonality: Weekly and yearly sales patterns

Tuned Optimal Hyperparameters: Improved forecasting accuracy

Actionable Forecasts: Useful for business decision-making
